3. Comments â€“
  1. The project has been modified to work in the python 3.x environment and hence is facing backward compatibility issues with the tester code.
  2. Upon independent testing for small words, long sentences, complex strings and NaN inputs, the program returned satisfactory results.
  3. A few comments and print statements have been added to enhance the readability of the code for the grader, and simplify debugging.
