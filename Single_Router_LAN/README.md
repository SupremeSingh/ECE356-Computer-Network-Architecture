Project Description - 

This lab assignment involved writing a simple router with a static routing table using Python. The router receives raw Ethernet frames, processes the packets just
like a real router, nd then forwards them to the correct outgoing interface. The Ethernet frames are generated by a Mininet/Pi=ox frameowrk maed by the class TA, 
this code defines the forwarding logic so packets go to the correct interface.
